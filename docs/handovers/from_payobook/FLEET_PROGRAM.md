# FLEET program — shipping to the fleet, and running it like a SaaS

Status: **COMPLETE 2026-09-04** — all six phases live; read `FLEET_CLOSEOUT.md` first (owner
decisions, debts). Started 2026-09-03. Source of the gap list: `docs/SAAS_RELEASE_STRATEGY.html`
("Shipping to the Fleet"). Owner picked the phased Fable-designs / Opus-builds cycle for the whole
stream and excluded three gaps (1 off-box backups, 2 restore drill, 11 sandbox). Everything else
in that document's PRIORITIES section is in scope here.

## Owner rulings (binding, 2026-09-03)

1. **Payments: invoices first, card later.** Each month the platform raises an invoice per customer
   from their plan and usage; the owner marks it paid when the bank transfer arrives. Overdue →
   reminders → suspension (auto-suspend is a platform switch, default OFF; suspending a live payroll
   customer without a human pressing something is not the default). No payment provider now; the
   invoice model must leave room for one later.
2. **Plans must support ALL THREE price structures, selectable per plan:** per active employee per
   month; per payslip produced per month; flat price per company by employee band (tiers). The
   meter therefore collects BOTH counts (active employees, payslips in the month) every time.
3. **Alerts by email only.** The apex already has an outgoing mail server (`ir_mail_server` row:
   Gmail, starttls) but 185 queued mails failed for two config reasons — no default sender
   (`mail.default.from` / catchall not set) and empty recipients. The alerts phase fixes the sender
   config and proves a real delivery before claiming alerts work.
4. **Memory ceiling: guard now, resize when the owner says.** Build the capacity gauge + a refusal
   to provision past the safe count + the exact resize runbook. The AWS resize itself is a separate
   owner-scheduled step (30–60 min downtime).
5. Standing rules apply (see every handover): no "Odoo" in any user-visible string; plain-English
   UI copy in the screen's vocabulary; Lucide icons via the shared `ic()` registries; `--pbim-*`
   tokens; no gradients/emoji; the WOW bar verbatim; commit per feature, never push.

## The six phases

| Phase | Gaps closed | What ships |
|---|---|---|
| **P1 Drift & stamp** | 3, 4 | Version-aware "In step with master" (install AND update), module-list refresh before install, 0-skipped check, `pb.release` cut from the master, release stamp per tenant, nightly drift check, the golden template on the same screen |
| **P2 Release & rollout** | 4, 9 (banner, what's new) | Rings (rehearsal / canary / early / everyone), a queued per-tenant rollout job with lock + retry + health gate + stop rule, the tenant-side agent module `pb_tenancy` (banner, what's-new, the push-parameter seam every later phase uses) |
| **P3 Alerts, capacity, status** | 5, 8, 9 (status page) | `pb.alert` events + dedup + email delivery (sender config fixed and proven), platform "Outgoing mail" check made real, memory gauge + provisioning guard + resize runbook, static status page nginx serves at `/status` with a staleness self-check, planned-maintenance notice |
| **P4 Feature switches** | 6 | `pb.feature` catalogue on the apex, per-tenant on/off with reason, pushed to tenants, `pb_tenancy` helpers (server + JS) and a `feature_key` gate on sidebar items so a switched-off feature vanishes cleanly |
| **P5 Plans, trial, suspend, invoices** | 7 | `pb.plan` (three price structures), tenant `trial`/`suspended`/`pending_deletion` states with a retention clock, monthly usage meter, invoices (own model, PDF, email, mark paid, overdue → reminder → optional auto-suspend), seat-limit enforcement + trial/limit banners on the tenant, customer-side "Plan & usage" card |
| **P6 Support access with a trail** ✅ | 10 | "Open as support" from the cockpit: reason required, one-time token, time-boxed session as the recovery account, every access logged on the tenant where the customer's administrator can read it, customer switch to refuse support access. **DONE 2026-09-03** — live on `payobook`, `payobook_template` and `abm` at release 2026.09.03-6; see `FLEET_P6_CLOSEOUT.md`. |

Handovers (all written 2026-09-03; later ones are adjusted from earlier reports before launch):
`FLEET_P1_DRIFT.md` · `FLEET_P2A_TENANCY.md` · `FLEET_P2B_ROLLOUT.md` ·
`FLEET_P3_ALERTS_CAPACITY_STATUS.md` · `FLEET_P4_FEATURE_SWITCHES.md` ·
`FLEET_P5_PLANS_BILLING.md` · `FLEET_P6_SUPPORT_ACCESS.md`.

Each phase: Fable writes `docs/handovers/FLEET_P<n>_*.md`, launches an Opus agent with it, reads
the report, updates the ledger below, designs the next. Owner is not asked between phases unless
a phase report shows a failure, a spec deviation, or a destructive/irreversible step.

## Verified plumbing (2026-09-03 — do not re-derive)

### The platform, as it is
- One server (`ssh Payobook19v2`), one process (no `workers`, no cron time limit — threaded), one
  `addons_path=/odoo/odoo-server/addons`, `dbfilter = ^%d$`, `limit_time_real = 1200`. Framework
  is Odoo 19 at git `db2cd8c1` (2026-06-16). RAM 1.9 GB. Registry LRU: `odoo/orm/registry.py:97`
  sizes it from `limit_memory_soft` (unset → 2048 MB / 15 MB ≈ 136) — i.e. NOT a real bound;
  physical RAM is the bound.
- Databases: `payobook` (master, 224 installed modules, 2.2 GB), `abm` (live tenant AB Mauri, 220
  installed), `payobook_template` (golden template, 203 installed, 117 MB), `p9clone` (1.7 GB
  rehearsal clone of the master from ACCESS P9 — owner debt: drop when no longer needed),
  `postgres`. Tenant `acme` (id 1) is **decommissioned**; its DB is gone. `pb_tenant` rows: 1 acme
  decommissioned, 2 abm live.
- Live drift today: abm has `pb_settings` and `pb_vendor_access` at 19.0.1.6.0 vs master 19.0.1.7.0
  (the Sync screen shows abm "in step" — the bug P1 fixes). Template is 21 modules behind.
- nginx: `sites-enabled/_` (apex, `server_name payobook.com`, `location ^~ /web/database/ {return 404;}`),
  `pb-wildcard`, `pb-tenant-abm.payobook.com.conf`. `/var/www/html` exists.
- Outgoing mail: 1 `ir_mail_server` (Gmail starttls, active). `mail_mail` states: outgoing 15,
  sent 11, cancel 176, exception 185 (reasons: "You must either provide a sender address explicitly
  or configure … mail.default.from"; "At least one valid recipient").

### `pb_tenants` (apex-only cockpit; never installed on a tenant)
- Manifest `pb_tenants/__manifest__.py` v19.0.1.4.0, depends `web, pb_import_kit, pb_sidebar, pb_hub`;
  assets `tenants.scss`, `pbtn_icons.js`, `tenants.js`, `tenants.xml`. Data: `security/ir.model.access.csv`
  (3 models, `base.group_system` full), `views/pb_tenants_action.xml` (client action tag `pb_tenants`),
  `data/pb_sidebar.xml`, `data/cron.xml` (nightly backups 19:30, certs 03:15, health hourly).
- Models `pb_tenants/models/tenant.py`: `pb.tenant` (state draft/provisioning/live/error/decommissioned;
  health cache fields; cert fields; `backup_ids`, `domain_ids`), `pb.tenant.backup`, `pb.tenant.domain`.
- Facade `pb.tenants` AbstractModel in `pb_tenants/models/service.py` (1730 lines). Every RPC starts
  with `_require_admin()` (:288). Helpers: `_param` :294, `_pg_cursor(db)` autocommit SQL :314,
  `_db_exists` :324, `_tenant_env(db)` ORM env on another DB, commits on success :353, `_probe` :360,
  `_log_line` :403, `_human` :414. Fleet: `get_fleet_data` :423, `_tenant_brief` :449,
  `_platform_status` :464 (checks list incl. `smtp` = `ir_mail_server` count > 0 :489 — a lie by
  omission, P3 replaces it). Provisioning :593–731 (`PROVISION_STEPS` :231; `_step_configure` sets
  `pb.tenant.slug` param :677 and re-enables template crons from param
  `pb_tenants.template_active_crons` :725–730). `_step_admin` :733; rails :770–980;
  `_ensure_break_glass` :792 (recovery account `platform.recovery@payobook.com`, no password, no
  email, has `base.group_system`). Sync: `TENANT_SYNC_NEVER` :171, `TENANT_SYNC_NEVER_PREFIXES` :193,
  `sync_split` :196 (NAMES ONLY), `_installed_on` :1102 (names only), `sync_report` :1123,
  `sync_install` :1178, `_sync_install` :1193 (`button_immediate_install` then a fresh env +
  `pb.access.reseed_catalogue()`). Detail/health :1388–1457 (`HEALTH_PROBES` :246). Backups
  :1461–1506, staging restore :1509, offboard :1545, domains :1573–1636, crons :1640–1730.
- Cockpit `pb_tenants/static/src/js/tenants.js` (388 lines): `PbTenants` OWL component, services
  orm/action/notification/dialog, `hubBack` chip, `state.view` ∈ fleet | wizard | sync | detail;
  `ic()` :52 merges `TIC` (pbtn_icons.js) with the kit registry. Sync screen :231–283; detail
  :284–381. Template `static/src/xml/tenants.xml` (529 lines): fleet :6, sync :293–390, detail
  :393+ with tabs overview/backups/domains/danger. SCSS `.tnx` scoped, `--pbim-*` tokens.
- Tests `pb_tenants/tests/`: `test_currency.py`, `test_tenant_admin_rails.py` (guards only),
  `test_tenant_sync.py` (pure `sync_split` + never-list asserted against disk + source-text
  assertions). Pattern: the decision is a pure function; the cross-database write is proven on a
  clone at deploy time and reported.

### Seams the later phases use
- **Tenant-side hook point:** `pb_sidebar/models/pb_sidebar.py` — `pb.sidebar.item` has `groups_id`
  :45, `restricted`/`restriction_reason` :51–57 (locked teaser), the ONE visibility rule
  `_state_for` :85, `visibility_for` :92, `get_sidebar_data` :121 (builds `_item_dict` :150). A
  `feature_key` gate slots into `_state_for`/`get_sidebar_data` (P4).
- **WebClient patch precedent (banner mount):** `biz_theme/static/src/js/biz_sidebar_menu.js:217`
  `patch(WebClient, {components: {...WebClient.components, BizSidebar}})`.
- **Settings hub cards:** `pb_settings/static/src/js/settings_hub.js` `CATEGORIES` :126 (card =
  `{id, tag|xmlid, icon, …}`); server gates `pb.settings.resolve_gates`
  (`pb_settings/models/pb_settings.py:110`) with `PLATFORM_ONLY_*` refusal. Customer-facing cards
  ("Plan & usage", "Support access", "What's new") are added here (P5/P6/P2).
- **Request seams (Odoo 19, server copy):** `odoo/addons/base/models/ir_http.py` `_authenticate`
  :271, `_authenticate_explicit` :276, `_pre_dispatch` :298, `_dispatch` :347, `_post_dispatch`
  :359; `addons/web/models/ir_http.py` `_pre_dispatch` :57, `session_info` :79.
  `odoo/http.py` `Session.authenticate(env, credential)` :1201 (credential dict has `login`,
  `password`/`type`; `finalize` :1240).
- **Tenant admin role:** `pb_vendor_access.role_tenant_administrator` (hooks.py:371), a bundle
  WITHOUT `base.group_system`. The customer's "administrator" is that role, so any customer-facing
  platform card must gate on something the role holds (the `access-team` ability is REQUIRED for
  the role — hooks.py:375) or on `pb.company.profile`'s existing gate, never on `group_system`.
- **Payslip meter:** tenants have `hr_payslip` (`om_hr_payroll/models/hr_payslip.py:30`,
  `date_from` :47, `date_to` :49, `state` :53). Active employees: `HEALTH_PROBES` SQL already.
- **Mail precedent on the apex:** `pb_lifecycle/models/letter.py:251` `action_send` builds
  `mail.mail` — note its :270 comment on empty `email_to`.

### Deploy + verify (authoritative: repo `CLAUDE.md` deploy contract)
- Clean staging dir; per-module scoped `rsync --delete` into `/odoo/odoo-server/addons/<m>/`;
  NEVER `--delete` with the addons dir itself as destination. `-d payobook` for the master.
- `pb_tenants` is installed on the master ONLY. `pb_tenancy` (from P2) is installed on the master,
  the template AND every tenant (it is a product module; the never-list stays the four).
- Every `odoo-bin` run alongside the live service passes `--http-port=8199 --gevent-port=8198`
  (or `--no-http` for shells) and `--max-cron-threads=0`. Detached `systemd-run` + sentinel for
  anything longer than an SSH keepalive. Never `pkill -f odoo-bin`.
- After JS/SCSS: purge `/web/assets/%` attachments AND bump `web.assets.version` per DB.
- Verify per DB: tree hashes repo↔server; `latest_version` vs manifest (normalise the `19.0.`
  prefix); "0 modules skipped" in the log; 15-minute cron window clean.
- Tests: `--test-enable --test-tags /pb_tenants -u pb_tenants -d <scratch or payobook>` — a
  bare `--test-tags` without a scoping `-u` crashes DB init (W9).
- Chrome-MCP validation on the live cockpit is mandatory before reporting done (design mandate).
  If the MCP tools are disconnected, drive Chrome over CDP on `127.0.0.1:9222` from a Node script
  (see the standing approval memory) — never skip.

## Design bar (verbatim, binding on every phase)

**"Extreme WOW, intuitive, out-of-this-world experience, best in class."** Not "clean and
functional" — the screen should make someone stop. Every phase must state and satisfy:
- a **hero moment** (a live preview, a diff that animates in, a grid that feels like a spreadsheet,
  a single reassuring sentence in plain language) — name it in the design;
- **zero dead-ends**: every state (empty, loading, error, partial, huge) is designed, every failure
  names its reason and its next step;
- **plain-language over code vocabulary** on every label, toast and summary;
- **motion with purpose** (enter/exit, progress, state change) — never decorative jitter;
- **keyboard + bulk ergonomics** where rows are involved (multi-select, shift-range, paste, undo);
- measured against the best consumer/SaaS tool in that category (Vercel, Linear, Stripe
  dashboards), not against stock Odoo.
Palette/tokens: `--pbim-*` (pb_import_kit), indigo `#5A4BB0` primary; promoted semantics only
(green `#2E7D4F`, amber `#D97706`, blue `#2563EB`, rose `#DC2668`); never invent a hex. Lucide
icons via `ic()`; new glyphs go in `pb_tenants/static/src/js/pbtn_icons.js` `TIC` (apex) or the
kit registry (shared). The phase report scores itself against this bar.

## Rails (every phase)

- **R1 Never a silent write to a customer's database.** Every cross-DB action is a person
  pressing a button with a dry run available, OR a queued job the person started, with a per-tenant
  log line. Crons may READ tenants freely; a cron that WRITES to a tenant (rollout worker, meter
  snapshot, banner push) only does what a person queued, and says so in the tenant's log.
- **R2 The never-list stands.** `pb_tenants`, `pb_demo`, `pb_demo_portal`, `pb_website` and the
  `pb_platform*` prefix never reach a tenant. Re-asserted on the literal list about to be written.
- **R3 The master is upgraded first, the template second, tenants last.** Nothing ships to a
  tenant at a version the master has not run.
- **R4 Rehearse on a restore.** Before the first real tenant of any phase's live validation, run
  the action on `<slug>-staging` restored from the tenant's latest backup.
- **R5 Cross-DB writes go through `_tenant_env` (ORM), never raw SQL**, so `ir.config_parameter`
  and other ormcaches on the running tenant registry are invalidated. Raw SQL is for reads.
- **R6 Pure decisions, tested.** Any decision that a test cannot reach because it touches another
  database is lifted into a pure function with its own test (precedent: `sync_split`, `currency_change`).
- **R7 Plain-English strings, no "Odoo".** Every user-visible string; technical identifiers untouched.
- **R8 Template hygiene.** Anything installed on `payobook_template` that creates crons: disable
  them afterwards and append their ids to `pb_tenants.template_active_crons` (the provisioning
  step re-enables from that list). A template with a live cron is a template with a hot registry.

## Ledger (F-numbers — every phase appends; gotchas AND rulings)

- **F1** (P0, 2026-09-03) `sync_split` compared names only; `abm` sat 2 versions behind while
  green. Version comparison must normalise the `19.0.` series prefix on BOTH sides and compare
  int-tuples (`1.10.0 > 1.9.0`).
- **F2** (P0) Python/JS behaviour reaches every DB at the next restart (shared addons tree);
  only XML/data/schema wait for `-u`. Hence R3, and hence the "master behind its own files" check.
- **F3** (P0) Odoo `ir.module.module.update_list()` is per-database; a `depends` added on the
  master leaves tenants unable to load until each tenant's list is refreshed (the 2026-08-19
  27-skipped incident). Refresh the list on the tenant before every install.
- **F4** (P0) `button_immediate_install/upgrade` rebuilds that DB's registry and closes the env;
  anything after it needs a fresh `_tenant_env`.
- **F5** (P0) The apex mail server exists but `mail.default.from` is unset → every mail without an
  explicit `email_from` dies in `exception`. Alerts set `email_from` explicitly AND fix the ICP.
- **F6** (P0) Registry LRU is sized from `limit_memory_soft`, which is unset → ~136 slots. The
  memory guard must measure real RSS/free memory, not the LRU.
- **F7** (P1, 2026-09-03) **The skipped check.** `Registry(db)._init_modules` is the set of modules
  the registry actually loaded (`odoo/orm/registry.py:256`, filled in
  `odoo/modules/loading.py:237`); `loading.py:495` computes the server's own "Some modules are not
  loaded" from the same idea. So *skipped = installed-in-the-database − `_init_modules`*, which is
  what `pb.tenants._skipped_on(db)` returns. It answers `-1` when the attribute is missing or empty
  rather than a green 0. Measured 0 on `payobook`, `abm` and `payobook_template`. No log grepping
  needed; the log fallback in the P1 spec was not used.
- **F8** (P1) **The two version fields are named the opposite way round.**
  `ir.module.module.latest_version` is the version THIS DATABASE has applied;
  `installed_version` is a compute off the manifest ON DISK
  (`addons/base/models/ir_module.py:285-289` says so in a comment). Both carry the `19.0.` series —
  `installed_version` because Odoo runs `adapt_version()` over the manifest — so `norm_version`
  handles either shape. Rail R3's check is `installed_version > latest_version`.
- **F9** (P1) **Upgrading anything on the golden template switches its scheduled jobs back on.**
  The template had 0 active jobs; upgrading `pb_settings` + `pb_vendor_access` left 9 active,
  because their cron records reload with `active` true. R8 is therefore not a build-time chore, it
  is part of every template touch, and `sync_bring_in_step` runs `template_cron_plan` at the end of
  each template run. The recorded list `pb_tenants.template_active_crons` went 41 → 52 ids: the 9
  live ones had never been recorded because they were created after the template was built.
- **F10** (P1) **A keyboard shortcut bound to `window` never fires in this web client.** Something
  in the shared client listens for `keydown` on `<body>` and stops the event there, so a `window`
  listener (the obvious place, and where the cockpit's `r`/`Esc` started) hears nothing at all —
  silently. Bind to `document` with `{capture: true}` and bow out for `INPUT`/`TEXTAREA`/
  contenteditable and for any open `.o_dialog`/`.modal.show`.
- **F11** (P1) The deny-list, the split and every version judgement now live in
  `pb_tenants/models/sync_rules.py`; `service.py` re-exports the names, so existing imports are
  unchanged. `test_tenant_sync.py`'s source-text assertions were retargeted (`_rules_source()` for
  the owner-rule quote; `sync_bring_in_step` for the third guard) and gained the update path
  (`button_immediate_upgrade`), a `-u base` prohibition and a read-only assertion on the new cron.
- **F12** (P1) `pb.tenants.sync_bring_in_step` accepts three targets and nothing else: a tenant id,
  the string `template`, or `<slug>-staging` where `<slug>` is a real tenant (rail R4's rehearsal
  door). Every other name is refused by name. `sync_install` is now a thin wrapper over it.
- **F13** (P2A, 2026-09-03) **`HttpCase` cannot reach a single route on this server without
  `--db-filter=.*` on the command line.** The live configuration picks the database out of the
  hostname (`dbfilter = ^%d$` in `/etc/odoo-server.conf`), and a test client calls itself on
  `127.0.0.1`, which resolves to a database named `127`. Every route then answers **404 with an
  HTML body**, so the failure looks like a broken controller rather than a routing mismatch — it
  cost two full test cycles here. The full command is
  `odoo-bin -c … -d payobook -u <mods> --test-enable --test-tags /<mods> --db-filter=.*
  --http-port=8199 --gevent-port=8198 --max-cron-threads=0 --stop-after-init`.
  Second half of the same gotcha: `self.authenticate('admin', 'admin')` fails on every live
  database, because the administrator's password is not `admin`. An `HttpCase` here creates its own
  user with a known password in `setUp` (see `pb_tenancy/tests/test_tenancy.py`).
  Also: `odoo-bin`'s output does NOT go to the shell — `logfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log` is
  set in the config, so a `> /tmp/x.log` redirect captures nothing but the sentinel. Read the
  server log for `odoo.tests.result: N failed, M error(s) of K tests`.
- **F14** (P2A) **The tenant-side poll runs on every visible tab, not only while a notice is
  showing.** The P2A spec asked for the cheaper rule (poll only while a notice is up, plus on
  becoming visible); that rule cannot satisfy the phase's own acceptance test, because a page with
  no notice would never discover that one had been sent. `pb_tenancy`'s service therefore polls
  `/pb_tenancy/state` every 60 s **while `document.visibilityState === "visible"`**, plus
  immediately when a hidden tab comes back after more than 60 s. Measured consequence, and it is
  the one to remember when validating: **a background tab does not update.** Chrome-MCP drives
  several tabs, and the tenant tab is hidden while the cockpit tab is being driven — so "the bar
  did not appear" during validation was the design working, not a failure. Bring the tenant tab to
  the front (`select_page` with `bringToFront`) before timing anything.
- **F15** (P2A) **An OWL `t-foreach` loop variable must never be called `lt`.** `t-as="lt"` compiles
  to `<.id` / `<.name` in the generated JavaScript — the template compiler rewrites the name into a
  literal `<` — and the WHOLE component then fails with
  `Failed to compile template "…": Unexpected token '<'` and a blank screen with an "our side" error
  dialog. Nothing points at the loop; the only clue is the generated source in the console. Assume
  the same for any other HTML-entity name (`gt`, `amp`, `quot`). Name loop variables for what they
  hold (`cust`, `row`, `mod`).
- **F16** (P2A) **JavaScript built-ins are not in scope inside an OWL template.** A template
  expression is compiled against the component, so `String(x)` becomes `ctx.String(x)` and throws
  `TypeError: ctx.String is not a function` — but only when that branch is first rendered, which
  here was the moment a `t-foreach` over an initially-empty list gained its first row. Coerce on the
  component side; templates hold property access and comparisons only.
- **F17** (P2A) **`<input type="datetime-local">` speaks the reader's wall clock; the server speaks
  UTC.** Passing one straight to the other moves every window by the operator's offset (seven hours
  on this box) with no error anywhere — the platform owner types "22:00 tonight" and the customer's
  bar announces maintenance in the middle of their morning. `tenants.js` converts both ways
  explicitly (`_forInput` UTC→local for the two boxes, `_toUtc` local→UTC for the preview AND the
  send, so the preview cannot disagree with what is delivered). Verified end to end: 22:00–01:00
  local typed on the cockpit stored as `12:00–15:00` UTC and rendered back as `tonight 22:00–01:00`
  on the customer's screen.
- **F18** (P2A) **Where the tenant banner mounts, and why not where P1's spec guessed.** Two modules
  on this build (`biz_theme/static/src/xml/biz_sidebar_menu.xml:8` and
  `pb_sidebar/static/src/xml/webclient_patch.xml:4`) already `position="replace"` the SAME
  `//ActionContainer` node; a third would be a race between load orders. `pb_tenancy` inserts
  `<PbTenancyBanner/>` **after `//NavBar`** instead, which nothing else touches. The server's own
  `web.WebClient` is four lines (`NavBar` inside `t-if="!state.fullscreen"`, then `ActionContainer`,
  then `MainComponentsContainer`), so the bar inherits the fullscreen guard — correct: a full-screen
  surface is a surface with no chrome.
- **F19** (P2A) **Only the `pb.tenants` facade's OWN cross-database writes go through `_tenant_env`;
  the asset ritual on a tenant does not.** Purging `/web/assets/%` and bumping `web.assets.version`
  with `psql` leaves the running tenant registry's ormcache holding the old version. The attachments
  being gone makes the bundle rebuild anyway, so the visible result is right — but restart the
  service after the SQL rather than relying on that.
- **F20** (P2A) `ir.config_parameter.set_param(key, '')` **writes an empty string, it does not
  delete the row** (`addons/base/models/ir_config_parameter.py:94` unlinks only on `False`/`None`).
  So clearing a notice leaves `pb_tenancy.notice` present and empty, which is what the reader
  expects. Related: `pb_tenants.template_active_crons` lives on the **template's** database, not the
  master's — looking for it on `payobook` finds nothing and looks like data loss. On
  `payobook_template` it holds 52 ids, and all 58 of that database's scheduled jobs are inactive
  (rail R8, verified after this phase's install).
- **F21** (P2A) `type='json'` is a **deprecated alias** on this framework — `odoo/http.py:788` logs
  "Since 19.0, @route(type='json') is a deprecated alias to @route(type='jsonrpc')" on every boot.
  New routes use `type='jsonrpc'`, and a read-only one adds `readonly=True`.
- **F23** (P2B, 2026-09-03) **An unset Datetime reads as `False`, not `None`.** Every helper that
  takes "a moment or nothing" must test falsiness, not identity: `if dt is None` lets the boolean
  through and the next line asks it for its `tzinfo`. It broke the state machine the first time a
  wave finished (`ring_done_at` empty). Same family as F20.
- **F24** (P2B) **`ir.config_parameter.get_param` cannot express "deliberately empty", and lies
  about "absent".** It answers **`False`** for a key that is not there — not `None` — and its body
  ends in `or default`, so a value explicitly set to `''` also comes back as the default. A list
  parsed from it therefore became `["False"]`, a filter that filters nothing and looks exactly like
  a working one. Any setting where empty is a meaningful answer must `search` the
  `ir.config_parameter` row and read `.value` (`pb.tenants._log_ignore` is the pattern).
- **F25** (P2B) **The health gate needs an ignore list, because this box makes noise.**
  `vendor_license_core` writes one `ERROR` on **every registry load of every database** ("License
  check FAILED: missing — License file not found at /opt/vendor_license/license.json"). It stopped
  the first rehearsal of the first rollout on a copy that was in perfect health. A gate that cries
  wolf on every run is a gate the owner learns to click past. `rollout_rules.DEFAULT_LOG_IGNORE`
  plus the setting `pb_tenants.health_ignore` (one substring per line, case-insensitive); ignored
  lines are still RECORDED on the task and counted on screen, never deleted.
- **F26** (P2B) **Restoring a database logs errors of its own**, so a health window that starts
  before the restore blames the update for them: `odoo.sql_db: bad query … SELECT latest_version
  FROM ir_module_module` ×2, because the framework asks a half-built database what version it is
  on. The rehearsal's window starts when the UPDATE starts. Related, and rail R4: the restore call
  belongs INSIDE the `try` whose `finally` drops the copy — outside it, a damaged backup leaves a
  part-restored database on a box with 1.9 GB of RAM.
- **F27** (P2B) **The health gate's exact log query.** `/var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log`, last
  ≤ 20 MB only (the file is ~85 MB), lines matching
  `^(<ts>),\d+ \d+ (\w+) (\S+) ([^:]+): (.*)$` where the level is `ERROR`/`CRITICAL`, the database
  column equals the target database, and the timestamp is ≥ the moment the update started. **The
  server's clock is UTC and the framework stores UTC, so the two compare as strings with no
  arithmetic** — the day this box moves to a local zone, that comparison is what quietly stops
  working. The logger name is kept in the stored line: it is the only part that says which piece of
  the product complained.
- **F28** (P2B) **A rollout is written down once and walked; the tests must stand down the real
  fleet.** `TransactionCase` on `payobook` runs against real `pb.tenant` rows and real `pb.rollout`
  rows, so a live customer joins every plan (`filtered()` stops being a singleton) and a genuinely
  paused rollout makes every test fail with "one is already going out" — the guard working, against
  the suite. `setUp` decommissions the tenants and aborts the rollouts inside the transaction,
  which is rolled back and never reaches them.
- **F29** (P2B) **A test cursor's `commit` refusal is bolted to the INSTANCE, not the class.**
  `patch.object(type(self.env.cr), 'commit', …)` does nothing; `patch.object(self.env.cr, 'commit',
  lambda: None)` is what lets a cron body that commits per customer be tested at all.
- **F30** (P2B) **"Run now" skips the window, never the queue.** `advance()` only ever looks at the
  CURRENT wave, so setting `run_now` on a customer in a later wave silently did nothing. That is
  the right behaviour — the order of the waves is the safety argument — so it is now a refusal by
  name pointing at "Continue now", and the button is only offered inside the active wave.
- **F31** (P2B) **Rail R4 must be enforced, not hoped for.** With the only usable backup file moved
  aside, `plan_tasks` shrugged, left the rehearsal out with a warning, and offered to update a real
  customer with nobody having rehearsed anything. No backup + at least one live customer is now a
  blocker on Start, naming the customer and the button that takes a backup.
- **F32** (P2B) **A customer's window has to be SAID in the customer's clock.** `render_range`
  formats whatever it is handed, so handing it UTC printed "today 15:00–18:00" on a screen whose
  next line said "on their clock". `to_local(dt, tz)` converts first; the plan and the Updates tab
  now read "tonight 22:00–01:00 · their time · Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh". F17 is the same trap pointing the
  other way.
- **F33** (P2B) **Measured: one customer task is seconds, not minutes, on this fleet.** abm
  (1.2 GB, 153 employees) took **8 s** for a one-module version move and **1 s** with nothing to do;
  the golden template 8 s and 1 s; the rehearsal **80–86 s**, of which ~60 s is the restore of a
  219 MB backup. So the "being updated right now" bar is genuinely up for about a second here — a
  fact to remember when validating, not a bug. The pre-notice, the in-progress notice and the clear
  are all provable from `pb_tenant.provision_log` and the rollout's own trail.
- **F34** (P3, 2026-09-03) **Measured: a second customer's registry costs about
  5 MB of resident memory on this box, and that number is far too small to be the
  capacity guard.** RSS before and after `_tenant_env()` on `payobook_template`:
  219.4 → 224.0 MB (**+4.6 MB**, 0.8 s); a second call on the same database
  **+0.0 MB** (registries are cached); `abm` after it **+3.9 MB** (0.9 s); with a
  real read workload on top of each (all users, all modules, all field
  definitions, 500 employees, a view count) **+5.6 MB** and **+4.9 MB**. Repeated
  in a second process: identical. Odoo's own comment sizing the registry LRU says
  "a registry takes 10MB of memory on average", so the measurement is in the
  expected place. But a per-customer cost of 5 MB puts "room for 54 more
  customers" on a 1.9 GB box, which is a guard that can never fire. The resident
  registry is not what a customer costs: sessions, asset caches and the working
  set of a pay run are, and they are transient and unmeasurable at rest. So
  `pb_tenants.tenant_cost_mb` is set to **60** — the measured 5 MB plus a
  deliberate allowance — and it is a setting, on the Alert-settings dialog, to be
  re-weighed as customers are added. With 870 MB free and 400 MB reserved that
  reads "room for 7 more customers". **The number in the setting is a policy, not
  a measurement; the measurement is the 5 MB above.**
- **F35** (P3) **The cockpit's own stylesheet has TWO root blocks, and the second
  one is not `.tnx`.** `tenants.scss` is `.tnx { … }` (lines 2–292) and then
  `.tnx-notice { … }` (300+), and the detail/updates/timeline rules live inside
  the SECOND. A block appended "at the end of the file, before the closing brace"
  therefore compiles to `.tnx-notice .tnx-capbar` and matches nothing — the
  capacity bar shipped 0 px tall with no error anywhere. P3's styles are now their
  own root-scoped section (the two dialogs are scrims, exactly like the notice
  composer, which is why that block is root-scoped in the first place).
- **F36** (P3) **`min()` in SCSS is the compiler's own function and it refuses to
  mix units.** `max-height: min(64vh, 640px)` fails the WHOLE bundle, and the
  failure is not local: the cockpit renders as unstyled HTML under a red banner
  reading "A css error occured, using an old style to render this page". Use a
  single unit, or `#{}` interpolation.
- **F37** (P3) **The shared kit out-specifies a bare class.** Kit buttons are
  styled `.pbim .pbim-btn.outline` (three classes); a state rule written
  `.tnx-alertchip.bad` (two) loses, silently. The alerts chip stayed indigo while
  a customer was unreachable. Any state colour on a kit control needs `.pbim` on
  the front.
- **F38** (P3) **A static page has no reader to ask what time it is.** F17 and F32
  are about converting to a KNOWN clock — the operator's browser, the customer's
  zone. A file on disk has neither, so a window rendered straight from the stored
  UTC printed "today 12:34–18:34" for a maintenance slot the owner typed as 22:34.
  The public page now converts to the platform's own zone and NAMES it
  ("tonight 19:34–01:34 · Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"), which is the only honest form.
  Verified live against the customer's own bar showing 22:34–04:34 in the reader's
  browser clock at the same moment: two different sentences, both correct.
- **F39** (P3) **The 15-minute sweep must read the log ONCE, not once per
  customer.** P2B's `_log_errors_since` reads a 20 MB tail for one database; the
  sweep asks about every live customer plus the master every quarter of an hour.
  `_log_error_counts(dbnames, since)` does the same regex, tail and ignore list
  (F25) in a single walk. The master's own error count is gathered and is
  deliberately NOT alerted on — this box logs its own test runs and the licence
  line, and a rule for it would have to be written against that noise first.
- **F40** (P3) **The stamp that says "we told you" is only written when the
  message actually left.** If a send fails and the alert is stamped anyway, the
  problem goes quiet for two hours on the strength of an email nobody received —
  the exact failure this phase exists to end. `_speak()` stamps per record after
  `_send_alert_mail` returns ok, and a failed send raises `alert_channel_down`,
  which is the one kind `reconcile()` never resolves on its own (no reading can
  see it) and the one kind that is rendered as a banner at the top of the fleet.
- **F41** (P3) **Validation alerts must be DELETED, not left to resolve.** A
  resolved critical becomes an incident on the PUBLIC page for seven days. The
  three alerts raised by moving thresholds during live validation
  (`backup_stale:abm`, `cert_expiring:abm`, `disk_low`) were unlinked afterwards
  so the page does not advertise incidents that never happened. Any future live
  test of the alert path has to end the same way.
- **F42** (P3) **The go-live checklist used to hide itself the moment the five
  provisioning checks were green**, which would have hidden P3's two new rows —
  including the "Send a test email" button, which is wanted on a good day too.
  The card now shows while ANY check is unfinished and is one click away from the
  live strip ("Platform checks") when they are all green.
- **F43** (P3) **The word "odoo" reached a user-visible string through a system
  ACCOUNT name.** "create /var/www/pb-status and give it to the odoo user" is a
  technical instruction, and the standing rule is still absolute for anything on
  a screen: it is now "…and let the application write to it". The test that
  caught it asserts `'odoo' not in a['text'].lower()` for every alert kind and is
  worth copying into any phase that writes operator-facing sentences.
- **F44** (P3) **A file written by a model is not rolled back by a test.** The
  suite runs against a fabricated fleet inside a transaction that is thrown
  away — but `alert_ack`, `alert_resolve` and P2A's `notice_send` all rewrite
  `/var/www/pb-status/index.html`, which is not in that transaction. A test run
  on the live platform therefore PUBLISHED a page built from invented customers.
  It was harmless the day it was found and one fabricated critical away from
  telling the world about an incident that never happened. `_write_status_page`
  now returns early when `odoo.tools.config['test_enable']` is set — at the
  writer, not in each test, because the next caller will be written by somebody
  who has not read the comment. Proved: the page's timestamp does not move
  across a full 238-test run, and moves again on the next five-minute job.
  Odoo 19 has no `registry.in_test_mode()`; `config['test_enable']` is the
  marker the framework itself uses.
- **F45** (P4, 2026-09-03) **A `<function>` in a data file with no arguments
  needs `@api.model` on the method.** `odoo/tools/convert.py:193` reads the
  FIRST argument of a `<function model= name=/>` as the records to call it on
  (`record_ids, *args = args`) unless the method carries the model-level
  marker. With neither, the upgrade dies on **"not enough values to unpack
  (expected at least 1, got 0)"** and the traceback names the XML line, not the
  method it could not reach — `pb_tenants/data/pb_feature.xml`'s closing
  `_push_features_here` cost a whole upgrade cycle. `_seed_feature_keys` in
  `pb_tenancy` was written the same way and was fine, because it happened to
  carry the decorator.
- **F46** (P4) **`@api.model` IS NOT INHERITED, and forgetting it on an
  override takes the whole left menu away from everybody.** The browser calls
  `pb.sidebar.item.get_sidebar_data` with no ids; the framework decides how to
  call it by reading the marker off the function it is about to invoke
  (`odoo/service/model.py:86`). `pb_tenancy`'s override of it left the
  decorator off, so every page in the product came back with no navigation and
  a "Something went wrong on our side" dialog, one minute after the master was
  upgraded. **No Python test can see this**: a test calls the method directly
  and both shapes work. The gate is now an assertion on the MARKER
  (`test_t3_03`), for `get_sidebar_data` and `visibility_for` both.
- **F47** (P4) **`useState`'s return value IS the subscription.** A component is
  registered against the reads it makes THROUGH the object `useState` hands
  back; `useState(someReactive)` with the result discarded watches nothing at
  all, silently. Three surfaces had it that way and would each have needed a
  page reload to notice a switch. Second half of the same rule: watch a value
  that only changes when the answer changes. `apply()` replaces the feature
  maps with fresh objects on every read, so a component watching a map would
  repaint once a minute for ever — `features_sig`, one string, is what they
  watch.
- **F48** (P4) **A browser-side reactive cannot update a menu the SERVER drew.**
  The rail is fetched once per page load, so no amount of watching state in the
  browser redraws it. `pb_tenancy` compares the answer it just polled with the
  one it had and fires the rail's own `PB_SIDEBAR:RELOAD` bus event when they
  differ — and deliberately not on the first read, which is the same answer the
  page was painted from a moment ago.
- **F49** (P4) **Python-style adjacent string literals blanked the whole backend
  again — and the gate that catches them exists.** `_t("part one "\n "part
  two")` in `pb_hub/static/src/js/hub_feature_off.js` produced an unparseable
  `web.assets_backend`, an empty page and a completely clean server log. W74 all
  over again, and `pb_hub/tests/test_static.py` has asserted against it since
  the last time. It did not fire because the phase ran its tests scoped to the
  two modules it was WRITING (`/pb_tenants,/pb_tenancy`). **The test scope must
  name every module the phase edits**, which here was six.
- **F50** (P4) **Two presses of "Start rollout" inside ninety seconds are two
  rollouts, and they destroy each other's practice run.** The "already going
  out" blocker is real, but `rollout_start` runs the whole rehearsal before it
  commits, so a second call in that window sees no rollout at all. Both then
  restore and drop `abm-staging` under each other: the first dies with
  "connection already closed", the second with "could not serialize access due
  to concurrent update", and both stop — correctly — with nothing having
  reached a customer. `rollout_start` now takes
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('pb_tenants.rollout_start'))` on entry, so the
  second press waits and then gets the refusal it should have had.
- **F51** (P4) **The rehearsal copy is a shared resource with one name.** Every
  rollout's practice run is `<slug>-staging`, restored and dropped by whoever
  is running. That is fine while exactly one rollout exists (F50 now enforces
  it) and is the reason a paused rollout must be called off rather than left
  lying about: a second one started later would restore the same copy again.
- **F52** (P5, 2026-09-03) **`_mail_shell` was a NAME COLLISION on a shared
  facade, and it broke a button two phases old.** `pb.tenants` is one model
  assembled from six files; `alert_service.py` already had a `_mail_shell(heading,
  intro, blocks, footer_note='')` and this phase's billing file defined its own
  with a different signature. Python's MRO did what it is supposed to and the
  platform's "Send a test email" button started failing with
  `TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'footer_note'` — in a file
  nobody would have opened. **A helper added to a facade is added to every file
  that shares it.** The phase's helpers are now `_billing_mail_shell` /
  `_billing_mail_box`. It was caught only because the test scope named every
  module the phase touched (F49's rule), not just the two it was writing.
- **F53** (P5) **`request.env.user` is an EMPTY recordset on a route declared
  `auth='none'`, even when somebody is signed in** — and `has_group()` on an
  empty recordset raises `ValueError: Expected singleton: res.users()`. The
  paused door caught it in its own fail-open handler and let EVERY request
  through, silently, on every page. `/odoo` on this build is exactly such a
  route (biz_deroute's redirect to `/bizapp`), so the door was open on the first
  hop of every navigation. Read `request.env.uid or request.session.uid` and
  browse the user explicitly. Second half of the lesson: a fail-open handler
  must put the REASON in its log line, not only in a traceback — the line is the
  only thing anybody greps, and here a silent failure means an open door.
- **F54** (P5) **`<div class="article">` is what gives a printed document its
  character set.** `ir_actions_report._prepare_html` hands wkhtmltopdf one file
  per `article` div, each wrapped in `web.minimal_layout` — the only template
  that carries `<meta charset="utf-8"/>`. A report with no `article` div falls
  through to a fallback (`ir_actions_report.py:438`) that hands the printer a
  bare fragment; the printer reads it as Latin-1, and every `₫` becomes `â‚«`
  and every `—` becomes `â€"`. **It renders, it looks deliberate, and it goes
  to the customer.** The invoice's page div is `class="article page"` with the
  `data-oe-model`/`data-oe-id` attributes the standard layouts also set.
- **F55** (P5) **A report with no `title` in its context is titled "Odoo
  Report".** `web.report_layout` renders `<title t-esc="title or 'Odoo
  Report'"/>`, and that string becomes the PDF's DOCUMENT title — what a PDF
  viewer shows in its window and what the file's properties carry. It is a
  user-visible string like any other (rail R7). `<t t-set="title">…</t>` before
  the `t-call`. Related: a page that prints no header must also set
  `data_report_margin_top` / `data_report_header_spacing`, or the paper format
  reserves ~35 mm for a header that is not there.
- **F56** (P5) **A cross-database write from OUTSIDE the server process is
  invisible to it.** `_tenant_env` committed and stopped. The database-wide
  invalidation sequence is bumped only by `Registry.signal_changes()`, which the
  framework calls at the end of a request or a cron and which nothing here
  called. It went unnoticed through P2A, P2B and P4 because the cockpit runs
  INSIDE the server: the tenant registry it clears IS the object serving that
  tenant's requests. Drive the same facade from an `odoo-bin shell` — as every
  live validation does — and the platform says a customer is un-paused, their
  database agrees in SQL, and their people go on meeting the locked door.
  `_tenant_env` now calls `reg.signal_changes()` after the commit. This also
  makes the whole facade correct the day this box gains a second worker.
- **F57** (P5) **The kit's dialog scrim is `pbim-modal-scrim`, with ONE hyphen
  — the only part of that primitive that is not BEM** (`__head`, `__body`,
  `__foot`, `__x`, `__sp` all are). Written the BEM way it matches no rule at
  all, so the dialog renders INLINE, in the flow of the page, with no overlay,
  no centring and no error. All five dialogs this phase added had it. Second
  half: `.pbim-modal__body` carries no padding of its own, so every dialog
  supplies it or its content runs flush to both edges under an inset title.
- **F58** (P5) **`t-att-x` bound to a JavaScript `true` renders the attribute
  with an EMPTY value.** `t-att-aria-pressed="autoSuspendOn"` therefore never
  matches `[aria-pressed="true"]`, and the auto-suspend switch sat grey and
  motionless beside a paragraph in red saying it was on. A control that
  disagrees with its own explanation is worse than no control. Bind the string:
  `t-att-aria-pressed="flag ? 'true' : 'false'"`.
- **F59** (P5) **A backup taken from a shell with the wrong `HOME` contains no
  file store, and still says "done".** There is no `data_dir` in
  `/etc/odoo-server.conf`, so the file store is `$HOME/.local/share/Odoo` and
  the service's `HOME` is `/odoo`. An `odoo-bin` run started with
  `--setenv=HOME=/tmp` (which a detached `systemd-run` needs for other reasons)
  writes and reads a DIFFERENT, empty file store: `backup_now` produced a 9 MB
  archive with 5 files in it beside a real one of 219 MB with 1,280, and
  recorded it as a good backup. It was deleted. **Every `odoo-bin` invocation
  that touches attachments — a backup, a restore, a report — must run with
  `HOME=/odoo`**, and a suspiciously small backup is the symptom to look for.
- **F60** (P5) **A plan priced by company size must be created WITH its bands,
  in one write.** The model refuses a `flat_tier` plan with no bands, which is
  correct — and a data file that creates the plan and then adds
  `pb.plan.tier` records fails that constraint in between and takes the whole
  upgrade with it. The seed uses an inline `tier_ids` eval; `plan_save` builds
  `[(5, 0, 0)] + [(0, 0, …)]` into the same write.
- **F61** (P5) **"Payslips produced" is `state NOT IN ('draft', 'cancel')`, and
  on the one live customer that is nought.** A draft payslip is arithmetic
  somebody is still doing and a rejected one never happened; charging for either
  is charging for work the customer did not get. The four remaining states
  (`verify`, `level1`, `level2`, `done`) all count. Measured consequence on this
  fleet: AB Mauri's 36 payslips are ALL drafts, so a per-payslip plan invoices
  them ₫0 — which is the honest answer and the reason the live validation put
  them on the flat-tier plan instead (owner decision, see the P5 report).
- **F62** (P6, 2026-09-03) **A route declared `auth='none'` is READ-ONLY by
  default on this framework.** `odoo/http.py:947` —
  `default_mode = routing.get('readonly', default_auth == 'none')`. Signing
  somebody in writes (the login log, the last-login stamp, this phase's own
  row), so the support door answered *"cannot execute INSERT in a read-only
  transaction"*. The framework knows how to recover from that — `_serve_db`
  catches `ReadOnlySqlTransaction` and runs the whole request again on a
  read/write cursor (`odoo/http.py:2274`) — but the controller's blanket
  `except Exception` caught it first and turned it into "your link has
  expired", hiding the real fault for a whole test cycle. Two rules out of it:
  **say `readonly=False` on a route that writes**, and **never wrap
  `authenticate()` in a bare `except Exception`**. The same reasoning is why
  `_pre_dispatch` deliberately re-raises `ReadOnlySqlTransaction`: most pages in
  this product are served on a read-only cursor, and swallowing it there would
  silently lose the end of a support session.
- **F63** (P6) **`invalidate_recordset()` DISCARDS a write that has not been
  flushed.** `write()` puts the value in the cache and queues the flush;
  `invalidate_recordset()` throws the cache away and re-reads the database — so
  a test that writes, invalidates and then asserts reads exactly the value it
  was asserting against, and the failure looks like the write never happened. It
  cost two test cycles here. Use `env.flush_all()` when the point is to see the
  write; `invalidate_recordset()` is for forgetting, not for refreshing.
- **F64** (P6) **`assertRaises` takes a savepoint and rolls it back.**
  `odoo.tests.common.BaseCase` documents it as "clears the environment upon
  failure", which is right for the usual case and wrong whenever the whole point
  of the refusal is that it LEAVES SOMETHING BEHIND — here, a refused support
  link marked on the customer's own record. Wrapped in `assertRaises` the row
  went back to `issued` twice before it was noticed. Catch the exception by hand
  (`try/except … else: self.fail(...)`) whenever the side effect is the subject.
- **F65** (P6) **`HttpCase` owns the session cookie, so a login performed inside
  a CONTROLLER is ignored by every later request in the test.** The harness pins
  `session_id` on `domain=''` in `setUp`; the server then sets its own cookie for
  `domain='127.0.0.1'`, the pinned one is sent first and wins, and every
  following request arrives signed out — which looks exactly like a broken login
  seam. The framework's own comment inside `authenticate()` describes the trap.
  Build the session the harness's way (`session_store.new()` + `session_token =
  security.compute_session_token(...)` + re-point the opener) when the test is
  about what happens AFTER somebody is in; test the door itself separately.
  Related, and the second half of F13: `--db-filter=.*` gets a test client past
  the hostname rule and then leaves five databases matching and none chosen, so
  every request 404s with "No database is selected" — a signed-out `HttpCase`
  must send `X-Odoo-Database`.
- **F66** (P6) **A page load is thirty requests, and a route log that records
  requests is a record of nothing.** The first version of the support trail
  wrote down every stylesheet, avatar, translations bundle and websocket
  upgrade; the two screens somebody actually opened were invisible among
  thirty-three lines of `/web/image`. Only the backend addresses (`/bizapp`,
  `/odoo`) are screens. Second half: **the request seam sees the address before
  the page has a NAME**, so recording on the address alone left every line
  reading "Payobook" — the browser-side bar reports again when `document.title`
  changes, and a repeat of the same address fills the name in rather than being
  deduplicated away.
- **F67** (P6) **The fifteen-minute sweep is the wrong channel for something
  that just happened.** Everything P3 mails is a fault that will still be a
  fault in a quarter of an hour. A support session is an act, and a
  thirty-minute session ended after two minutes is resolved before the sweep
  ever looks — so the owner heard nothing at all about a session on a live
  customer. The mail now goes on the press of the button, stamped only if it
  actually went (F40), and skipped under `config['test_enable']` because the
  suite's own attempts wrote five ERROR lines per run into the log the rollout

- **F68** (P6) **Not everything raised is a problem, and the alert email did not
  know that.** `_mail_new_alerts` assumed `warning` was the floor: an `info`
  alert went out as "Worth a look … One new thing needs you … Something needs
  your attention" about a deliberate, routine act. That is how an inbox learns
  to scroll past the one thing it must never scroll past. It now says "For
  information / Worth knowing" when nothing worse is in the group. Related:
  reading the record the instant the button is pressed finds a link *issued but
  not yet used* — treating that as "nothing is running" closed the alert about a
  session that had not begun (`pending` now covers `issued` as well as `active`).
