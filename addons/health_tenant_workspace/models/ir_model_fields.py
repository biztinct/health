r"""Field labels, tooltips and selection labels — the canonical rules on top.

ERRORS E3-1. Core asks ``ir.model.fields`` for the translated label and help of
every field it describes (``odoo/orm/fields.py:958`` ``_description_string``,
``:965`` ``_description_help``, ``odoo/orm/fields_selection.py:209``), so these
three methods ARE the seam for everything a tooltip shows.

``web_debranding`` already overrides them, and for a tooltip it mostly works —
measured on ``rztest`` 2026-09-11, all 37 ``ir_model_fields.help`` rows that
name the vendor come back clean. What its rule cannot do is the shapes it was
never taught:

* ``OdooBot``. Its word rule ends ``(?!\w)``, so a vendor name with a letter
  glued to it is refused. ``res.users.odoobot_state`` was therefore labelled
  ``Trạng thái OdooBot`` on every screen that shows a field label.
* ``Odoo S.A.``, and every whole-sentence replacement E2 added (E2-4).

Rather than widen a gutted module's regex, the canonical ``debrand_text`` is
applied on top. It is a no-op for everything ``web_debranding`` already fixed
(the pre-filter no longer matches), so this layer only ever catches the
remainder.

Cached with the same key as the layer below it — ``_description_help`` is called
once per FIELD, and a model can carry a thousand of them, so an uncached pass
over the whole dict would be quadratic. The cache lives in the registry's
``default`` cache, which ``_biz_debrand_apply_brand`` already clears on every
brand save (see scrub.py) and which a registry reload rebuilds from scratch.
