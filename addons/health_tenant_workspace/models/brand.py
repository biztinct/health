"""Brand resolution + the single canonical text-rewrite used by every seam.

Everything that rewrites a user-visible string — the Python ``_()`` patch, the
QWeb tree walker, the Apps-list ``read()`` override, the data scrub and the
JavaScript runtime — goes through :func:`debrand_text` so the rules stay in one
place and behave identically on both sides of the wire.

The brand is per-database (this deployment is DB-per-tenant SaaS), so it is
cached per db name and refreshed by ``ir.config_parameter._register_hook`` on
every registry load and by ``_biz_debrand_apply_brand`` on every save.

THE PRODUCT RULE (ERRORS E3-2) IS OPT-IN AND MUST STAY THAT WAY
---------------------------------------------------------------
The vendor rules above rewrite a word nobody's *data* is called. The product
rule is the mirror image: it rewrites the name of THIS product, and a tenant
may perfectly well have a company, a partner or an employer on a payslip
genuinely named "Payobook Vietnam JSC". Renaming one of those is a silent data
corruption, and it would be far worse than the bug the rule exists to fix.

So ``debrand_text`` takes the product name as an explicit fourth argument that
defaults to ``None``, and only the seams that rewrite text coming from SOURCE
pass it:

  ON   translate_patch      a ``_()`` msgid / catalogue entry, before the args
                            are interpolated
  ON   ir_ui_view           a server-rendered QWeb template's static prose
  ON   base.get_view        a backend view arch
  ON   ir_model_fields      a field label / tooltip / selection label
  ON   ir_module_module     Apps-list text, re-imported from __manifest__.py
  ON   JS seam 1 + seam 2   ``_t()`` templates and static OWL templates

  OFF  scrub.py             STORED ROWS. This is the one that would rename a
                            customer's company.
  OFF  JS seam 3            the notification service sees the FINISHED message,
                            interpolated record names and all
  OFF  debrand_url          ``payobook.com`` is a host that resolves; rewriting
