"""Restore Python-side debranding of translated strings on Odoo 19.

``web_debranding``'s own translation monkey-patch (``web_debranding/translate.py``)
was disabled during the Odoo 19 port — "Translation internals have changed" —
so every ``_()`` / ``_lt()`` / ``env._()`` string containing the vendor name has
been reaching users verbatim. That covers user-facing errors such as
"Odoo is unable to merge the generated PDFs." and
"Odoo is currently processing another module operation.".

Rather than resurrect the removed ``GettextAlias._get_translation`` hook, we
wrap the single funnel that survives in Odoo 19:
``odoo.tools.translate.get_translation(module, lang, source, args)``. Both
``get_text_alias`` (``_``) and ``LazyGettext._translate`` (``_lt``) call it.

Two bindings must be patched: the module attribute, and the *direct* import in
``odoo.orm.environments`` (``from odoo.tools.translate import get_translation``,
environments.py:21) which backs the modern ``self.env._(...)`` idiom.

The vendor name is stripped from the *template*, never from the interpolated
arguments — so a record whose own name contains the vendor word is left alone.

That is also exactly what makes this seam safe to run ERRORS E3-2's product
rule through. `_('Paid by %s') % company.name` has the rewrite applied to
`Paid by %s` and never to `company.name`, so a customer genuinely called
"Payobook Vietnam JSC" survives a database where the product rule is on.

The two languages are asked different questions. In ``en_US`` there is no
catalogue and the msgid is the output, so the cheap pre-filter runs on the
source. In every other language the catalogue entry is resolved FIRST and the
pre-filter runs on the *translation*: a string whose English does not name the
vendor may well have a translation that does (``calendar``'s Vietnamese
catalogue, ERRORS E2-2), and filtering on the msgid let every one of those
through.
