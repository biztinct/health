One home for access management, and it belongs to no particular product.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS

  * **Roles, written the way people talk.** A curated layer over the permission
    groups an application already has: a plain name, one sentence saying WHAT
    THIS LETS SOMEONE DO, and the people who hold it. It adds no permission
    primitive and invents no tier — there is still exactly one place access is
    decided, and this is a readable window onto it.
  * **A role is a bundle of abilities.** An ability is the small unit somebody
    recognises — "approve a visit", "read the audit trail" — and it carries the
    one or more permissions that sentence really costs. Roles are built out of
    abilities; nobody builds one out of raw permissions, because a job that
    needs two of them should not have to be split into two rows nobody
    recognises. Abilities are data, so covering a new one costs no release.
    Holding a role means holding ALL of it, and lending one means holding all of
    it first.
  * **One home, with lenses over the same truth.** A lens bar, and role cards
    that OPEN OUT into the three questions people actually ask — what does it
    open on the left menu, what does it let them do, and who holds it. Which
    screens a role opens is never written down on the role: it is worked out by
    matching what the role carries against what each left-menu entry asks for,
    on the server. Re-gate a screen and every role's answer changes with it,
    because there is only ever one answer.
  * **A passport for every person, and a pair of spectacles.** The People lens
    answers the other question — not "who holds this role" but "what does this
    person have". Their LEFT MENU is drawn as they see it, entry by entry, and
    the states come from the menu's own code rather than from a copy of its
    rule. Under it, every role they carry and the reason they carry it — theirs,
    or lent until a date by somebody named. "See it as…" in the header repaints
    the whole home as somebody else's reality; it is a VIEW and can never be
    anything else, because nothing on this screen takes "who am I looking at" as
    an argument to a write.
  * **The left menu, drawn as the left menu, with its gates on it.** The Screens
    lens answers the third question — WHO SEES THIS SCREEN. No permission-group
    name appears anywhere on it: an older permission that is part of a role is
    named as that role, and one that belongs to no role is a count.
  * **A builder that shows the outcome while you build it.** "New role" is a
    name, one honest sentence, and a list of ABILITIES to tick — never a raw
    permission — beside a miniature of the left menu that lights up as they are
    ticked. Nobody has to imagine what they are about to hand out.
  * **Hand-overs that take themselves back.** Somebody going away lends what
    they hold to somebody covering, until a date. Activation adds only what the
    lender ACTUALLY HOLDS — checked on the server, not just hidden in the dialog
    — and writes down exactly what it added. A nightly job removes precisely
    those permissions, only where they are still there, and tells both people.
  * **One audit trail, and it has no delete button.** Every hand-over, and every
    role given or taken away on the board, is a row in the same table. `unlink`
    is refused for everybody, an administrator included.

IT SEEDS NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This module ships no roles, no
abilities and no vocabulary of its own beyond one neutral area, because the
words on an access board are the application's words and not this one's. An
application registers four things and gets a full home:

  * its areas — `access_common.register_areas([...], default=...)`;
  * its own administrator tier, if that tier should also manage access —
    `access_common.register_manager_groups(...)` on the server and
    `registerAccessManagerGroups(...)` in the browser;
  * a callable that seeds its own catalogue — `hooks.register_catalogue(fn)`;
  * an adapter over its own left menu — `access_common.register_rail(provider)`.

THE LEFT MENU IS A SEAM, NOT AN INHERIT. Two of the four lenses are about a left
menu, and every product's is a different model with a different shape. So this
module declares what it needs of one (`access_common.RailProvider`) and reads
and writes it through `biz.access.rail`. It ships NO provider. Installed on its
own it boots to a working, empty, honest Access home whose Screens lens says, in
words, that this system has no left menu yet.

THE ONE ABSOLUTE. Nothing here can ever hand out the system administrator
permission (`base.group_system` / `base.group_erp_manager`). The role and
ability models refuse to be created pointing at one — over the whole implied
closure, so a permission that merely IMPLIES it is refused too — and the facade
checks again before it writes. Three refusals for one rule, because it is the
only rule in the module whose failure cannot be undone by somebody who is still
able to log in.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. No new permission system, no approval chain on a
hand-over (notifications are the requirement and they are enough), and no
opinion whatsoever about what an application's roles should be.
