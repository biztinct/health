/**
 * `biz_access_home` — the Access home.
 *
 * ONE HOME, AND LENSES OVER THE SAME TRUTH.
 *
 *   **Roles** — "who can do what". Each role is a card carrying its plain name,
 *   the sentence saying WHAT IT LETS SOMEONE DO, and the faces of the people
 *   who hold it. The sentence is the hero: a permission group called "Manager"
 *   tells nobody anything, and every mistake this screen exists to prevent
 *   starts with somebody granting a thing they could not name. Opened out, a
 *   card answers the three questions in the order somebody asks them: what does
 *   it OPEN, what does it LET THEM DO, and who HOLDS it.
 *
 *   **People** — "what does this person have". A searchable list of everybody
 *   with a login, and beside it a PASSPORT: their left menu drawn as they see
 *   it, and every role they carry with the reason they carry it. The picture of
 *   the menu is the hero, because "I cannot find that screen" is the
 *   sentence this lens exists to answer, and a list of permission names does
 *   not answer it.
 *
 *   **Screens** — "who sees this screen". The left menu drawn AS the left menu,
 *   in its own order and with its own icons, each entry carrying the ROLES that
 *   open it and — while the spectacles are on — whether that person can open
 *   it. It is also the only place a gate is edited, which is the point: before
 *   it, the only way to change one was a list of permission-group names, and
 *   that is exactly why the live menu ended up with no gates on it at all.
 *
 *   **Hand-overs** — "who is covering for whom". A running hand-over shows the
 *   days left on it, because the thing worth knowing about temporary access is
 *   when it stops being temporary.
 *
 * THE LENS BAR IS A REGISTRY, NOT A ROW OF BUTTONS. `LENS_REGISTRY` below is
 * the list, the bar draws whatever is in it, and the body switches on the key —
 * which is how the Screens lens landed as one line in that array plus a branch
 * in the template rather than as a rewrite of this file.
 *
 * "SEE IT AS…" IS A VIEW AND CAN NEVER BE ANYTHING ELSE. The header picker
 * repaints the lenses as somebody else's reality; `state.seeing` is where that
 * choice lives and `state.seeingHeld` is what they hold. Nothing in this file
 * passes either into a write: granting and lending both name their target
 * outright, in their own dialog, and the simulator has no way to reach them.
 * The next lens subscribes by reading those two, and by nothing else.
 *
 * WHICH SCREENS A ROLE OPENS IS NOT DECIDED HERE, AND MUST NOT BE. It is worked
 * out on the server, by the same rule the real left menu uses, and arrives ready
 * to draw (`biz.access.role_detail` / `preview_rail`). A copy of that rule in
 * this file would be a second answer to a question that must only ever have one
 * — and it would be the answer somebody trusts while it is wrong.
 *
 * AND THERE MAY BE NO LEFT MENU AT ALL. This module ships no menu of its own; a
 * product registers one. Every lens that draws one therefore has an honest empty
 * state, and the server says in words why it is empty — the Screens lens is not
 * a blank pane on a database nobody has plugged a menu into.
 *
 * THE DIALOG SHOWS THE SENTENCE BEFORE THE BUTTON. Granting and delegating both
 * put the description in front of the person doing it, at full size, with the
 * name of the person it will apply to. No confirmation dialog that only says
 * "Are you sure?" — a question nobody can answer is not a safety rail.
 *
 * THE ADMINISTRATOR PERMISSION IS NOT ON THIS SCREEN AND CANNOT BE PUT ON IT.
 * The catalogue excludes it, the model refuses it and the facade refuses it
 * again. This file does not need to know that, and deliberately does not check
 * — a client-side check on a server-side absolute is a check that will one day
 * be the only one.
 *
 * R1 — no `t-as` variable is named lt / gt / lte / gte / and / or / not / in.
 * R2 — every sentence is ONE expression.
 * R82 — people are drawn with `avatar_128`, never `image_128`: the latter
 * renders a grey camera when the field is unset, which answers 200 and looks
 * broken only to a human.

     * HOW WHAT IS BEING BUILT DIFFERS FROM A ROLE THAT ALREADY EXISTS.

     * The question people actually ask in front of this dialog is not "what
     * have I ticked" — they can see that — but "is this not just the Records
     * manager role again". Two roles that grant the same things are the one
     * mistake this screen can make that nobody notices for a year, and the
     * refusal on Create says so far too late to be useful.
     *
     * So the comparison is made WHILE they tick, against the role that is
     * closest to what they have built (or against the one they started from,
     * which stays the anchor however far they wander). It is derived entirely
     * from what the builder already read — every role's ability list is in
     * `composer_options` — so it costs no call, no round trip and no new shape.
     *
     * A role with nothing in common is not offered: "compared with a role that
     * shares nothing" is noise, and the honest answer there is silence.
