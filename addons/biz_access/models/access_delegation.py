"""`biz.access.delegation` — one person's access, lent to another, and taken back
by the calendar rather than by somebody remembering.

THE WHOLE MODEL IN FOUR SENTENCES.
A delegation names who is lending, who is borrowing, which profiles, and until
when. Activating it adds the profiles' groups to the borrower — and NEVER a
group the lender does not hold themselves. What it actually added is written
down, exactly, on the record. Ending it removes precisely those groups and
nothing else.

WHY THE SNAPSHOT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
"Remove the profiles' groups at the end" is the obvious implementation and it is
wrong in both directions. It over-removes: a borrower who already held one of
those groups in their own right loses it, permanently, because a temporary loan
ended. And it under-describes: if somebody edits the profile between the loan
starting and ending, the end takes back something different from what the start
handed over. So `applied_group_ids` is the DIFFERENCE the activation actually
made — measured, not predicted — and the revert works from that.

AND IT ONLY EVER REMOVES WHAT IS STILL THERE. A group that was revoked by an
administrator during the window is not re-added and then removed; a group the
borrower has since been given permanently is not taken away. The log says which
of those happened, because "3 delegations ended" over a night that could not
actually take one of them back is the cheerful-number failure this ledger has
recorded five times (R54, R76, R92, R100, R101).

HISTORY IS NEVER DELETED. `unlink` is refused for everybody, including an
administrator, and the ACL grants it to nobody. An audit trail with a delete
button is a diary, not an audit trail.

THE AUDIT TRAIL IS ONE TABLE. A permanent grant made from the roles board is
also a row here — kind `permanent`, with the reason somebody typed. So the
question "how did this person come to hold that" has one place to look rather
than two.
