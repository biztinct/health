"""`biz.access.ability` — one thing somebody is allowed to do, named the way they
would name it.

WHY THIS MODEL EXISTS. A role used to be one permission group with a nicer name.
That works right up until a real job needs two permissions — "manage the
workforce plan" is two of them, "administer the formula engine" is three — and
at that point the catalogue has to either invent a role per permission (which
puts the technical shape of the system back on the screen) or hand out a group
that carries more than the sentence promised. Neither is honest.

So a role is now a BUNDLE. It is made of abilities, and an ability is the small
unit somebody can actually recognise: a plain sentence, an area, and the one or
more permissions that sentence really costs. Roles are assembled from abilities;
nobody assembles a role out of raw permissions any more, because the raw
permissions are not offered — an odd permission that deserves handing out
becomes an ability first, and an ability is DATA, so that costs nobody a deploy.

THIS IS STILL NOT A SECOND ACL. Access is decided in exactly one place on this
database — `res.groups` and the record rules — and this model adds no primitive.
It is the vocabulary layer, and its whole job is that the sentence a person reads
before they press the button is the truth about what they are about to hand over.

THE ABSOLUTE, RESTATED HERE TOO. An ability may never carry the administrator
permission for the whole system, and — new in this layer — it may never carry a
permission that QUIETLY IMPLIES one. A group that implies the master key IS the
master key; checking only the group named on the row would let the one rule this
module cannot afford to lose be walked around by one level of indirection.
