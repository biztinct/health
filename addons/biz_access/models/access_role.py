"""`biz.access.role` — permission groups, in words a person can act on.

THIS IS A PRESENTATION LAYER, NOT A SECOND ACL. There is exactly one place
access is decided on this database and it is `res.groups` plus the record rules;
this model adds no primitive, invents no tier and grants nothing on its own. It
is a CURATED CATALOGUE: a plain-English name, one sentence saying what it lets
somebody do, an area, and a pointer at the group that actually carries it.

WHY A CATALOGUE AND NOT A LIST OF EVERY GROUP. This database has some hundreds
of `res.groups` rows, most of them technical, several of them named "User". A
screen that dumps them is a screen nobody can use safely, and "grant" on a row
called "User" is how somebody gets given something nobody intended. So the
catalogue is DATA — seeded with the tiers this product actually has, editable by
an administrator, and every row carries the sentence that says what it means.

THE ABSOLUTE, RESTATED AT THE MODEL. A profile may never point at
`base.group_system` or `base.group_erp_manager`. The seed does not contain them,
this model refuses to be created or written pointing at one, and both facades
check again before they apply anything. Three refusals for one rule, on purpose:
this is the only rule in the module whose failure cannot be undone by a person
who is still allowed to log in.

WHO SEES WHICH PROFILE. `visible_group_id` is optional and is the answer to the
handover's "growth-plan profiles are visible only to the heads of HR": a profile
that names a group is only listed to people who hold that group. It hides a ROW
FROM A CATALOGUE; it is not a permission, and the record rule below is what
enforces it.

A ROLE IS NOW A BUNDLE. It used to be exactly one permission group, which is
true of every role this product happens to have today and false of the next one
somebody asks for: "plan and approve the workforce" is two permissions, and a
catalogue that can only name one either splits the job into two rows nobody
recognises or hands out more than the sentence promised. So a role holds
ABILITIES (`biz.access.ability`), each ability carries its own permissions, and
`group_ids` is the union — worked out, stored, and never typed.

`group_id` IS FROZEN, NOT GONE. Every role on this database was one group before
bundles existed, and the column still says which. Nothing reads it to decide
anything any more; it stays because deleting the answer to "what was this before"
is how an upgrade becomes impossible to check afterwards, and because the unique
constraint on it is still the thing stopping two rows quietly meaning the same.

    #: row and most rows are open to everybody. The bar of applications above it
    #: is not curated at all: it is whatever every installed module put there,
    #: it grows every time something is installed, and a role that had to list
    #: what it DOES see would be silently wrong the day after the next install.
    #: So a role names the handful it does not, and anything new is visible by
    #: default — which is exactly how the bar behaves today.
    #:
    #: An EMPTY list means this role hides NOTHING, and it says so loudly:
    #: somebody who holds it keeps the whole top bar, whatever their other roles
    #: hide. That is the direction that can only ever open a door, and reading
    #: it the other way round cost one doctor 489 screens — the story is in
