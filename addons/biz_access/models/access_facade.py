"""`biz.access` — the Access home's facade.

FOUR LENSES OVER ONE TRUTH.

  **Roles** — who holds what. A profile, the sentence saying what it lets
  somebody do, and the people who hold it. Granting and removing happen here,
  through a dialog that shows the sentence before the button.

  **People** — what does one person have, drawn as the left menu they actually
  see, and every role they carry with the reason they carry it.

  **Screens** — who can open each entry on the left menu, and through which
  role. It is also the only place a gate is edited.

  **Hand-overs** — who is covering for whom, until when, and what they were
  given. Anybody internal can lend what they hold; the access team can lend on
  somebody else's behalf and can take any of it back.

THIS FACADE OWNS NO LEFT MENU. Two of its four lenses are about one, and it
reads and writes it entirely through `biz.access.rail` — the seam a product
plugs its own menu into. On a database where nothing has registered a provider
those two lenses answer honestly and empty; nothing here falls over, and nothing
here invents a menu that is not there.

WHAT THIS FACADE REFUSES, AND WHY IT REFUSES IT HERE.
The catalogue cannot contain the administrator permission and the model will not
let it (`biz.access.role._check_group_is_not_the_keys_to_the_building`), so
these checks are the third of three. That is not belt-and-braces for its own
sake: a facade is the only layer that sees a request BEFORE it becomes a write,
and this is the one rule in the module whose failure cannot be undone by anybody
who is still allowed to log in.

HOLDING IS TRANSITIVE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE ROLES BOARD. `res.users.group_ids`
is direct membership only and misses everybody who holds a permission through a
ladder — which, on any real ladder, is most of the people who hold it. Every
"who holds this" question here goes through `res.groups.all_user_ids`, which is
the transitive set.

    # answers "what does this person have" — and the second question is the one
    # somebody asks when a colleague says they cannot find a screen. The answer
    # is a PICTURE of that colleague's left menu, not a list of permissions,
    # because the left menu is the thing they are both looking at.

    # sees an entry meant a list view of permission-group names, which is how
    # the live menu ended up with no gates at all: the screen that could change
    # them was unreadable, so nobody did. Here a gate is a ROLE — a name and a
    # sentence — and the row shows, while you edit it, who that lets in.
    #
    # NOT A SECOND VISIBILITY RULE. Every state on every row comes from the
    # registered provider's `visibility_for` — the same method the real menu and
    # the person passport ask. This section decides nothing; it reads, and it
    # writes gates back through the provider.
