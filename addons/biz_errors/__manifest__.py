Business Breakdown Screens
==========================

When a page fails, the person in front of it should meet the product, not the
platform.

This layer replaces every server-rendered error page on the public and staff
side with one design in several wordings: a brand wordmark, a line icon, a
plain-English headline, a way out, and a short support reference.

What it removes
---------------
* The Python traceback, the QWeb card and the raw error card. Nobody sees
  technical detail on screen any more, including a website designer and
  including anybody who asks for developer mode.
* The status code. It never appears on screen; it lives in the log line.
* Framework prose. Only the text of a genuine UserError — a sentence somebody
  wrote for a person — survives onto the page.

What it adds
------------
* A support reference, eight Crockford base32 characters grouped XXXX-XXXX,
  printed on the page and logged at ERROR beside the full traceback. One grep
  turns the code a customer reads out into the stack that produced it.
* The brand, read from biz_debranding.brand_name / web_debranding.new_name with no
  hard dependency on either, falling back to the company name and then to a
  neutral phrase. Never to a vendor name.

Deliberately untouched: the website 404 page, the backend error dialogs and the
developer-mode rail, each of which is already owned elsewhere.
