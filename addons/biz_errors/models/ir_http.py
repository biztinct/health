# Part of biz_errors — the branded breakdown screen.
# License LGPL-3.
"""The one seam that turns a crash report into a breakdown screen.

WHY ``_get_error_html`` AND NOT ``_get_exception_code_values``. The dispatch in
``http_routing/models/ir_http.py._handle_error`` is::

    code, values = cls._get_exception_code_values(exception)   # transaction may be ABORTED
    request.env.cr.rollback()                                  # cursor usable from here
    if code in (404, 403):  ... _serve_fallback()
    elif code == 500:       values = cls._get_values_500_error(...)
    code, html = cls._get_error_html(request.env, code, values)

``_get_exception_code_values`` runs before the rollback, so an
``ir.config_parameter`` read there can raise ``InFailedSqlTransaction`` — the
very exception being handled may have aborted the transaction.
``_get_error_html`` runs after the rollback and is reached by every status code,
so it is the single correct place to read the brand, mint a reference and blank
the technical values.

Everything here is wrapped in try/except on purpose. A breakdown page that
itself breaks is unrecoverable: the handler has nowhere left to go. A failure in
this module logs a warning and renders the stock page.
