"""Named slots a clinic may fill with its own facts.

Two tiers in one table:

* ``company_id = False`` — the **shipped default**, in a module data file,
  translated through ``vi_VN.po`` like every other piece of content. This is
  also the *declaration*: a key with no default row does not exist.
* ``company_id = <a company>`` — that tenant's **override**.

The hard rule, and the reason this table is deliberately small: overrides fill
NAMED SLOTS. They can never replace a lesson step, a quiz option, a consequence
card or a coach answer. The moment a tenant can edit prose you have twelve
divergent tutorials and no check can guard any of them.

Nothing here reads or writes a patient, a booking or an invoice, which is what
makes it safe to hand to a tenant administrator.
